# Product Requirements Document: Startup Discovery App

## Introduction/Overview

The Startup Discovery App is a Tinder-style web application designed to help investors discover new startup investment opportunities through an intuitive swipe-based interface. The app presents startups with their pitch videos and key information, allowing investors to quickly evaluate and connect with promising companies.

**Problem Statement:** Traditional startup discovery methods are time-consuming and inefficient. Investors often struggle to efficiently browse through numerous startup opportunities and establish initial contact.

**Goal:** Create an engaging, mobile-first web application that streamlines the startup discovery process for investors through an intuitive swipe interface.

## Goals

1. **Streamline Discovery:** Reduce the time investors spend finding and evaluating startup opportunities by 50%
2. **Increase Engagement:** Create an addictive, gamified experience that encourages daily usage
3. **Facilitate Connections:** Enable seamless communication between investors and startups
4. **Improve Conversion:** Increase the likelihood of investor-startup connections by 30%

## User Stories

1. **As an investor**, I want to quickly browse through startup pitch videos so that I can efficiently evaluate investment opportunities
2. **As an investor**, I want to see key startup information (name, description, industry, funding stage, team size, location) so that I can make informed decisions
3. **As an investor**, I want to swipe right on interesting startups so that I can initiate contact with the founders
4. **As an investor**, I want to swipe left on uninteresting startups so that I can move to the next opportunity
5. **As an investor**, I want to fill out a simple contact form when I swipe right so that I can express my interest to the startup
6. **As an investor**, I want to navigate through startups continuously so that I can discover new opportunities without interruption

## Functional Requirements

### Core Swipe Interface

1. The system must display startup cards in a Tinder-style interface with video content as the primary focus
2. The system must support left swipe gestures to pass on a startup and move to the next
3. The system must support right swipe gestures to express interest and open contact form
4. The system must provide physical buttons (left/right) as an alternative to swipe gestures

    - Startup name
    - Brief description (2-3 sentences)
    - Industry/sector
    - Current funding stage
    - Team size
    - Location
11. The system must present this information in an overlay on the video card
12. The system must ensure text is readable over video content

### Contact Form

13. The system must open a contact form modal when user swipes right
14. The system must collect the following information:

    - Email address
    - Message/interest description
15. The system must validate form inputs before submission
16. The system must send contact information to the respective startup
17. The system must provide confirmation feedback after successful submission

### Navigation & Flow

18. The system must implement infinite scrolling through startup cards
19. The system must load new startups automatically as user progresses
20. The system must maintain smooth transitions between cards
21. The system must handle edge cases (no more startups, loading errors)

### Responsive Design

22. The system must be fully responsive and work on mobile devices
23. The system must support touch gestures on mobile devices
24. The system must provide desktop-friendly interface with mouse interactions

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- User authentication and profiles
- Startup submission/management interface
- Advanced filtering or search functionality
- User preferences or favorites
- Chat or messaging system beyond initial contact
- Payment processing or subscription features
- Social features (likes, shares, comments)
- Analytics dashboard for startups
- Multi-language support

## Design Considerations

### UI/UX Requirements

- **Modern Tinder-like Interface:** Clean, card-based design with smooth animations
- **Video-First Design:** Videos should be the primary focus with information overlays
- **Mobile-First Approach:** Optimized for mobile devices with touch-friendly interactions
- **Color Scheme:** Professional yet engaging colors suitable for business context
- **Typography:** Clear, readable fonts with proper contrast ratios

### Key Components

- **SwipeCard Component:** Main card component with video and information overlay
- **ContactForm Component:** Modal form for investor contact
- **Navigation Buttons:** Left/right action buttons for desktop users
- **Loading States:** Skeleton screens and loading indicators

## Technical Considerations

### Frontend Framework

- **Next.js:** For React-based development with SSR capabilities
- **TypeScript:** For type safety and better development experience
- **Tailwind CSS:** For rapid styling and responsive design

### Video Handling

- **HTML5 Video API:** For video playback and controls
- **Lazy Loading:** For efficient video loading and performance
- **Fallback Support:** For browsers that don't support video formats

### Data Management

- **Static Data:** Hardcoded startup data for MVP phase
- **JSON Structure:** Organized startup data with video URLs and metadata
- **State Management:** React hooks for managing app state

### Performance

- **Image/Video Optimization:** Compressed media files for fast loading
- **Progressive Loading:** Load content as needed to improve performance
- **Caching:** Browser caching for static assets

## Success Metrics

### User Engagement

- **Daily Active Users:** Track number of unique users per day
- **Session Duration:** Average time spent browsing startups
- **Swipe Rate:** Number of swipes per session
- **Right Swipe Rate:** Percentage of right swipes (interest rate)

### Conversion Metrics

- **Contact Form Completion Rate:** Percentage of right swipes that result in form submission
- **Email Delivery Rate:** Successful delivery of contact emails to startups
- **Response Rate:** Percentage of startups that respond to investor inquiries

### Technical Performance

- **Page Load Time:** Under 3 seconds for initial load
- **Video Load Time:** Under 2 seconds for video playback
- **Mobile Performance:** Smooth 60fps animations on mobile devices

## Open Questions

1. **Video Hosting:** Should videos be hosted locally or use external services (YouTube, Vimeo)?
2. **Email Delivery:** What email service should be used for sending contact form submissions?
3. **Data Volume:** How many startup entries should be included in the MVP?
4. **Analytics:** What analytics platform should be integrated for tracking user behavior?
5. **Future Scalability:** Should the app be designed to easily integrate with external startup databases in the future?
